		<h2>What is the Raid Score?</h2>
		<p>We track attendance and loot distribution for all guild raid events. Some events will have a value assigned to them for different levels of participation and some looted items will have a cost associated with them.</p>
		<p>To come up with the "Raid Score" number, we divide a member's attendance score by their loot cost. This is done once for an overall score from all of time, and again to get scores based on events and loot from the past 30 days.</p>
		<h2>How are these scores used?</h2>
		<p>Class Leaders will sometimes refer to members' Raid Scores when deciding on loot distribution. These numbers help them determine how to more evenly give out items based on attendance and loot already received.</p>
		<p>Note that there are other more important variables that go into loot distribution before the Raid Score is even looked at. So while it is an important factor in some cases, usually there are more specific rules that apply to loot decisions first.</p>
		<p>See the guild's Charter for more details on loot distribution.</p>
		<h2>What is the 30DAR?</h2>
		<p>The 30DAR stands for "30 Day Attendance Rate" and is a percentage of primary raids the member has attended over the past 30 days.</p>
		<p>This figure helps Class Leaders get an idea of how much a member is participating in raids and is used more specifically to ensure Raiders are participating enough to maintain their rank.</p>
		<p>Note that the 30DAR will take time to establish for new members as the formula will still consider you as absent for raids that are within 30 days but for which you were not yet a member. This is intentional and not a glitch.</p>
		<p>Also note that being benched for a raid is counted the same as attended.</p>
